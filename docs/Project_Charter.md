# Project Charter: Microsoft Project Template Creation

## Objectives
Develop a reusable Microsoft Project template aligned with CAPM principles.

## SMART Goals
Specific (phases and milestones), Measurable (4-6 weeks), Achievable (using GitHub and Microsoft tools), Relevant (CAPM portfolio), Time-bound (September 2025).

## Scope
Modular data collection via Excel, custom field tracking.

## Stakeholders
Andrew John Holland (silicastormsiam).

## Triple Constraints of Project Management
- **Cost**: Budget capped at $500 for tools (e.g., Microsoft Project subscription).
- **Time**: 4-6 week timeline with milestones per CAPM phase.
- **Scope**: CAPM-aligned template with core features; excludes advanced automation.

These constraints will be monitored via the project board for balance.

## Measuring Product Success with "Launch and Landing"
- **Launch Metrics**: Template completion (100% phase coverage), user feedback (GitHub issues), initial adoption (stars/forks).
- **Landing Metrics**: Sustained usage (download counts), retention (80% after 3 months), ROI (planning time savings).

Metrics ensure long-term template value.
