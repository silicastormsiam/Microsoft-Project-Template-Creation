CAPM-Aligned Microsoft Project Template
Overview
This repository is dedicated to developing a reusable Microsoft Project template aligned with the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) principles, as defined by the Project Management Institute’s PMBOK® Guide. The template incorporates CAPM’s five process groups—Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing—and relevant knowledge areas, such as Scope, Schedule, Cost, and Risk Management. It serves as a portfolio showcase to demonstrate proficiency in project management skills, providing a standardized, customizable framework for efficient project planning and management across various project types.
Project Objective
The goal is to create a Microsoft Project template that adheres to CAPM’s process groups and knowledge areas, ensuring it is:

Reusable: Adaptable to different project types (e.g., software development, construction).
Well-documented: Clearly aligned with CAPM principles.
Professional: A valuable portfolio piece to highlight structured project management expertise.

The template will include tasks, milestones, dependencies, and resources, designed to reflect CAPM methodologies and enhance project management efficiency.
Development Plan
The development of the template is structured into iterative steps to ensure alignment with CAPM principles and usability. Tasks are tracked in a linked GitHub Project at https://github.com/users/silicastormsiam/projects/8/views/1, with automated workflows to manage issues and pull requests.
Current Step: Define and Design Template Structure
The current phase focuses on creating a detailed blueprint for the Microsoft Project template, ensuring it incorporates CAPM principles and is reusable while demonstrating project management proficiency.
Key Activities

Identify CAPM Principles: Incorporate CAPM’s process groups and knowledge areas, such as:
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Critical Path Method (CPM)
Risk management processes


Define Template Components:
Task Structure: Develop a hierarchical task list based on the WBS, covering all project phases.
Milestones: Establish key milestones for each CAPM process group (e.g., “Project Charter Approved”).
Resources: Include placeholders for resource roles and cost estimates.
Dependencies: Set logical task dependencies and highlight the critical path.
Risk Management: Add tasks for risk identification and mitigation.
Custom Fields: Create fields for CAPM-specific attributes (e.g., “Process Group”).


Ensure Reusability: Design the template with generic tasks and customizable fields to suit various project types.
Leverage Microsoft Project Features: Utilize Gantt charts, resource sheets, and reports to enhance functionality and presentation.
Document CAPM Alignment: Create a companion document mapping template components to CAPM principles.
Update Repository: Store the draft template and documentation in a Template_Design folder and create issues for task tracking.

Deliverables

Draft Microsoft Project template file (.mpp) with tasks, milestones, and resources.
Documentation file mapping template components to CAPM principles.
Updated repository with draft files and a task list in the linked GitHub Project.

Timeline

Estimated Duration: 1–2 weeks
Key Tasks:
Reviewing CAPM principles
Designing the template
Documenting alignment



Success Criteria

Template covers all CAPM process groups and relevant knowledge areas.
Template is reusable and customizable for different projects.
Documentation clearly demonstrates CAPM alignment, enhancing portfolio value.

Issue Tracking
Tasks are managed using GitHub Issues, tracked in the linked GitHub Project at https://github.com/users/silicastormsiam/projects/8/views/1. Issues are organized with custom fields, including:

Phase: Indicates the CAPM process group (e.g., Initiating, Planning).
Milestone: Specifies associated project milestones (e.g., “Project Charter Approved”).
Status: Tracks progress (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

A GitHub Actions workflow automatically adds issues and pull requests to the project, ensuring seamless task management.
Next Steps
Following the design phase, the template will be:

Tested with a sample project.
Refined based on feedback.
Finalized for portfolio presentation.

Additional details will be added to this README as the project progresses.
