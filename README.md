CAPM-Aligned Microsoft Project Template

Explore a professional Microsoft Project template designed for CAPM excellence, showcasing structured project management skills.

Why This Project Matters
This repository develops a reusable Microsoft Project template aligned with the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) principles, as outlined in the PMBOK® Guide. It serves as a portfolio showcase, demonstrating expertise in applying CAPM’s five process groups—Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing—and key knowledge areas like Scope, Schedule, Cost, and Risk Management. The template is designed to be adaptable, professional, and a powerful tool for efficient project planning across diverse project types.

Project Objective
The goal is to create a Microsoft Project template that:

Adheres to CAPM process groups and knowledge areas.
Is reusable and customizable for various project contexts.
Is well-documented to highlight CAPM alignment.
Serves as a portfolio piece to showcase structured project management expertise.

The template includes tasks, milestones, dependencies, and resources, all designed to reflect CAPM methodologies.

Development Plan
The template is being developed through iterative steps to ensure CAPM compliance and usability. Tasks are tracked in a GitHub Project at https://github.com/users/silicastormsiam/projects/8/views/1, with automated workflows for seamless issue and pull request management.
Current Step: Define and Design Template Structure
This phase focuses on creating a detailed blueprint for the Microsoft Project template, ensuring CAPM alignment and reusability.
Key Activities



Activity
Description



Identify CAPM Principles
Incorporate process groups and knowledge areas (e.g., Work Breakdown Structure, Critical Path Method, Risk Management).


Define Template Components
- Task Structure: Hierarchical task list based on WBS.- Milestones: Key CAPM milestones (e.g., Project Charter Approved).- Resources: Placeholders for roles and costs.- Dependencies: Logical task links and critical path.- Risk Management: Tasks for risk identification and mitigation.- Custom Fields: CAPM-specific fields (e.g., Process Group).


Ensure Reusability
Generic tasks and customizable fields for diverse projects.


Leverage Microsoft Project
Use Gantt charts, resource sheets, and reports for enhanced functionality.


Document CAPM Alignment
Create a companion document mapping template to CAPM principles.


Update Repository
Store draft template and documentation in a Template_Design folder; track tasks via issues.


Deliverables

Draft Microsoft Project template file (.mpp) with tasks, milestones, and resources.
Documentation file mapping template components to CAPM principles.
Updated repository with draft files and task list in the GitHub Project.

Timeline

Duration: 1–2 weeks
Key Tasks:
Review CAPM principles.
Design template structure.
Document CAPM alignment.



Success Criteria

Template covers all CAPM process groups and knowledge areas.
Template is reusable and customizable.
Documentation clearly demonstrates CAPM alignment, enhancing portfolio value.


Issue Tracking
Tasks are managed via GitHub Issues, tracked in the GitHub Project at https://github.com/users/silicastormsiam/projects/8/views/1. Issues use custom fields:

Phase: CAPM process group (e.g., Initiating, Planning).
Milestone: Associated milestones (e.g., Project Charter Approved).
Status: Progress (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

A GitHub Actions workflow automatically adds issues and pull requests to the project for seamless task management.

Next Steps
The next phase includes:

Testing the template with a sample project.
Refining based on feedback.
Finalizing for portfolio presentation.

Updates will be added to this README as the project progresses.
